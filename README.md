# susi_skill_data
This is the storage place for susi skills. It is for now a temporary solution for a wiki-like skill editing service that we want to create in the near future.

## Installation
This repository must be cloned along https://github.com/fossasia/susi_server to make it available to susi.
The production platform of http://susi.ai will do a `git pull origin master` every minute. That means, every change will be available very soon.

## Create a new skill
Creation of a new skill is easy, DO NOT PANIC!

### Learn the skill language
Read https://github.com/fossasia/susi_skill_data/blob/master/README_susi_skill_language_tutorial.md and test your skill using a susi dream! Then, if your susi dream works, add the skill to this repository, read next topic...

### Add intents to a skill or create a new skill
The place to store your intents is a skill. A skill is simply a plain text file with '.txt' extension, placed within a language folder within a topic. So to add a new skill, you first have to choose a topic. You can choose from:

* Business and Finance
* Communication
* Connected Car
* Food and Drink
* Games, Trivia and Accessories
* Health and Fitness
* Knowledge
* Lifestyle
* Movies and TV Shows
* Music and Audio
* News
* Novelty and Humour
* Problem Solving
* Productivity
* Shopping
* Social
* Sports
* Travel and Transportation
* Utilities
* Weather

You can find these topics in https://github.com/fossasia/susi_skill_data/tree/master/models/general

Your skill must be placed in a language-dependent subdirectory. 
Place your intents along one existing skill, or create a new one.

If there is an expert which you want to extend, modify that expert file. If there is not already an expert file, create a new one. Choose a nice name which describes your expert, use lowercase letters only and give the expert file the file name extension ".txt".

Do **NOT** create a new model in the models subfolder and do **NOT** create a new topic in the models/general subfolder.
If you want a new topic, create an issue and describe your topic and it's purpose.
