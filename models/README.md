# models
A model is a set of skill categories.
In our [model theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_theory) a skill covers one aspect of the real world which is reflected with the propositions that the skill can do about that aspect. The actual execution of the propositions about such world aspects is done with https://github.com/fossasia/susi_server.

This path contains different models, each containing skill categories with skills for each language

Currently we have only two models:

# general
The general model contains all skills which a unmodified susi_server instance loads by default.
It has the basic "world knowledge" of "everything". All other skills would be personal or specific to a special user, user group or i.e. a personal home.
